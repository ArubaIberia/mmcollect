# mmcollect

mmcollect is a small tool to collect the output of "show" commands from all controllers (also called MDs or Managed Devices) connected to a Mobility Manager.

The basic usage requires just the IP address (or hostname) of the Mobility Manager, an username, and the command to run: 

```bash
# Will dump the "show version" command of all MDs managed by the MM
mmcollect -h your.mm.ip.address -u username "show version"
```

More advanced use cases are described below.

## Connecting to the MM and Controllers

mmcollect does not use a regular telnet/ssh connection to run the show commands, but the REST API of AOS 8.X. To connect to the API, the host where you run mmcollect needs connectivity to **TCP PORT 4343** of the MM and controllers.

A side effect of using the API is that show commands must be typed full, with no abbreviations. I.e. `show ip int brief` won't work, you need to type the whole thing: `show ip interface brief`

Another side effect is that filters behave a little different, i.e. `show ip interface brief | include vlan` does not do what you would expect. Filtering should be done using [jsonpath](https://github.com/oliveagle/jsonpath) expressions, see the filtering section below for some examples.

## Filtering

The output of "show" requests received through the REST API is not raw text, but json objects. You will notice if you try something like `show ip access-list brief`:

```bash
mmcollect -u admin -h your.mm.ip.address "show ip access-list brief"

      "Type": "session(4)",
      "Use_Count": null
    },
    {
      "Name": "allow-printservices",
      "Roles": null,
      "Type": "session(4)",
      "Use_Count": null
    },
# ... omitted for brevity
```

You see, you get a JSON object as a reply! mmcollect supports [jsonpath](https://github.com/oliveagle/jsonpath) syntax to filter the value returned by the controller. Say you want to collect only session access-list:

```bash
mmcollect -u admin -h your.mm.ip.address "show ip access-list brief | $.Access_list_table_4_IPv4_6_IPv6[?(@.Type == 'session(4)')]"
Password:

}
{
  "Name": "allow-printservices",
  "Roles": null,
  "Type": "session(4)",
  "Use Count": null
}
# ... omitted for brevity
```

Or you want only ACLs with the name "print" in it:

```bash
mmcollect -u admin -h your.mm.ip.address "show ip access-list brief | $.Access_list_table_4_IPv4_6_IPv6[?(@.Name =~ /print/)]"

### Concatenating filters

You can concatenate several filters, separated by pipes. The output of one filter is fed into the next one. **If the output of some filter is an array, you must skip the "$[ ]" part in the next filter**. I.e. **Instead of**:

```bash
mmcollect -u admin -h your.mm.ip.address "show ip access-list brief | $.Access_list_table_4_IPv4_6_IPv6[?(@.Type == 'session(4)')] | $[?(@.Name =~ /print/)]"
```

**Do**:

```bash
# Since the output of first filter is an array, we skip the starting "$[" and ending "]" in the second filter
mmcollect -u admin -h your.mm.ip.address "show ip access-list brief | $.Access_list_table_4_IPv4_6_IPv6[?(@.Type == 'session(4)')] | ?(@.Name =~ /print/)"
```

You can even do:

```bash
mmcollect -u admin -h your.mm.ip.address "show ip access-list brief | $.Access_list_table_4_IPv4_6_IPv6 | ?(@.Type == 'session(4)') | ?(@.Name =~ /print/)"
```

### Plain text filters

You can also use plain ol' **include** or **begin** keywords to filter strings or arrays of strings. If the output of one filter is a string or list of strings, the next filter can be an *include* or *begin*:

```bash
mmcollect -u admin -h your.mm.ip.address "show datapath session table | $._data | inc 10.1.2.3"
```

## Selecting the controllers to collect data

By default mmcollect runs the commands you provide in every controller that is "up", from the point of view of the MM. But you can narrow down on which controllers will the command be run, by specifyng a [jsonpath](https://github.com/oliveagle/jsonpath) filter with the *-f <filter>* command line option.

A few examples:

```bash
# Run the commands on Aruba 7005 controllers:
mmcollect -h your.mm.ip.address -u username -f "?(@.Model == 'Aruba7005')" "show version"

# Run the commands on controllers with SNMP Location matching regexp "Building1"
mmcollect -h your.mm.ip.address -u username -f "?(@.Location =~ /Building1/)" "show version"

# Run the command on controllers with status "UPDATE SUCCESSFUL"
mmcollect -h your.mm.ip.address -u username -f "?(@.Configuration_State == 'UPDATE SUCCESSFUL')" "show version"
```

Notice from the last example above how mmcollect replaces whitespace and other non-alphanumeric characters with underscores ('_') in attribute names, to workaround some problems with that kind of attributes in jsonpath expressions.

You can also specify several filter criteria separated by pipes, as usual:

```bash
# Run the commands on Aruba 7010 controllers with status "UPDATE SUCCESSFUL":
mmcollect -h your.mm.ip.address -u username -f "?(@.Model == 'Aruba7010') | ?(@.Configuration_State == 'UPDATE SUCCESSFUL')" "show version"
```

## Field selectors

Sometimes you don't want the full JSON object returned by the controller, but just a few fields. MMcollect lets you combine filtering with **sttribute selection**, usign the **>** sign after the command or filter. Name the fields you want extracted, separated by commas:

```bash
mmcollect -u admin -h your.mm.ip.address "show ip access-list brief | $.Access_list_table_4_IPv4_6_IPv6[?(@.Type == 'session(4)')] > Name, Type"
Password: 

2018/05/10 19:15:41 Getting the switch list
2018/05/10 19:15:41 Switch list collected, working on a set of 2
2018/05/10 19:15:41 Waiting for workers to complete!
CONTROLLER  x.x.x.x
allow-diskservices;session(4)
allow-printservices;session(4)
ap-acl;session(4)
captiveportal;session(4)
citrix-acl;session(4)
# ... omitted for brevity
```

## Running several commands in a row

You can run several consecutive commands, separated by a semicolon:

```bash
mmcollect -h your.mm.ip.address -u username "show ip interface brief; show user-table verbose"
```

Each command can have its own set of filters and field selectors.

```bash
mmcollect -h your.mm.ip.address -u username "show ip interface brief | inc vlan; show user-table verbose"
```

## Running several threads in parallel

Just add the *-t threads* option to the command line to set the number of parallel jobs. By default, it is 25.

```bash
mmcollect -h your.mm.ip.address -u username -t 50 "show ip interface brief; show user-table verbose"
```

## Delay between commands

What if you want to run some command a few times, like "show datapath session table", waiting a few seconds between each run? mmcollect got you covered with the flag *-d delay_seconds*:

```bash
# Run "show datapath session" twice, with 5 seconds delay between each run
mmcollect -u admin -h your.mm.ip.address -d 5 "show datapath session table | $.data; show datapath session table | $.data"
```

## Saving output to files

Finally, you can tell mmconnect to save the output of each controller to a separate file with the *-o <prefix>* flag. Each controller will get its outout saved to a separate file, named after the controller's IP address.

For instance, if you want to same all the logs into folder *logs* with names *switch-<IP.address.of.controller>.log*, give mmcollect the prefix *-t logs/switch-*:

```bash
# Run "show datapath session" three times, with 5 seconds delay between each run
mmcollect -u admin -h your.mm.ip.address -o logs/switch- "show datapath session table"
```

## Running in batch

If you want to run the command in batch mode (not interactively), you can provide the password through the *-p <password> flag, for example:

```bash
mmcollect -u admin -h your.mm.ip.address -p <your-password> "show datapath session table"
```

It may be wise to use environment variables or shell expansion instead of a literal password, so your credentials do not show up in the output of "ps -a", for example:

```bash
# Use an environment variable
mmcollect -u admin -h your.mm.ip.address -p "$MYPASS" "show datapath session table"
# Use a secret file
mmcollect -u admin -h your.mm.ip.address -p `cat ~/.secret_pass` "show datapath session table"
```

## Scripting

mmcollect can run a script once per controller. Set the path of the script with the *-s <filename>* flag, and mmcollect will read the file and run it after it finishes collecting the data of each controller.

The script must be valid JavaScript, and is parsed using the [otto](https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto) engine. The javascript code will have access to the following global variables and functions:

- data0: the result of the first show command.
- data1: the result if the second show command.
- ...
- data*N*: the result of the N-th show command.
- Post: a function that can be used to send HTTP POST requests to the current controller.

For instance, say you want to drop all users sending SMB traffic, using `aaa user delete`. You can look for port 445 in the output of the `show datapath session table` command, and POST a message to the controller to delete those users. Save this script as *aaa_user_delete.js*:

```js
// The script expects data0 to be the output of "show datapath session table | $._data | inc 445"
_.each(data0, function(line) {
  // The first field in the output of "show datapath session table" is the source IP.
  // The API call to delete an IP address is "/configurations/object/aaa_user_delete;
  // you can skip the "/configurations/", it is added by the `Post` function.
  var source_ip = line.match(/\S+/g)[0];
  Post("/mm", "object/aaa_user_delete", { "ipaddr": source_ip });
})
```

And then run your collector with *-s aaa_user_delete.js*:

```bash
mmcollect -u admin -h your.mm.ip.address -s aaa_user_delete.js "show datapath session table | $._data | include 445"
```
